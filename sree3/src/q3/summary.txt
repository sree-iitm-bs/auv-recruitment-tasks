From wikipedia:
Six degrees of freedom (6DOF), or sometimes six degrees of movement, refers to the six mechanical degrees of freedom of movement of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (normal axis), pitch (transverse axis), and roll (longitudinal axis)

Translational envelopes:

Moving forward and backward on the X-axis. (Surge)
Moving left and right on the Y-axis. (Sway)
Moving up and down on the Z-axis. (Heave)
Rotational envelopes:

Tilting side to side on the X-axis. (Roll)
Tilting forward and backward on the Y-axis. (Pitch)
Turning left and right on the Z-axis. (Yaw)
